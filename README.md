# MEDAlarm
MEDAlarm is a smart medicine storage device aimed at helping people adhere to medication regimens. The current design is a prototype based on an STM32 with 
only the simple functionality of setting a timer and the automated opening and closing of the storage compartment. It is specially designed for seniors who 
may have difficulty with remembering to take their medication and handling conventional pill bottles. It was originally conceived as a project for ECE 198: Project Studio. The design document for the original course is available for further details.
